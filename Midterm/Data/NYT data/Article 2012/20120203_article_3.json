It's been a long time since I studied statistics and probability (and maybe I never did, depending on how you define \"study\"), but it seems to me that this betting line is saying a few things.

Or third, if one team is trailing toward the end of the fourth quarter, it might well get a chance to kick a field goal to tie or win the game. Lastly, and this, really, is the red zone I'm driving toward: Everything will probably just come down to, in Peyton Manning's memorable words, an \"idiot kicker.\"", "print_page": null, "section_name": "Magazine"}, {"headline": {"main": "The Week in Culture Pictures, Feb. 3", "kicker": "ArtsBeat"}, "snippet": "A slide show of photographs of cultural events from this week....", "pub_date": "2012-02-03T18:26:59Z", "slideshow_credits": null, "news_desk": null, "word_count": "13", "keywords": [], "abstract": "A slide show of photographs of cultural events from this week.", "_id": "54f2d36f38f0d8529ba34f0b", "source": "The New York Times", "byline": {"original": "By THE NEW YORK TIMES", "person": [], "organization": "The New York Times"}, "web_url": "http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/03/the-week-in-culture-pictures-feb-3/", "subsection_name": null, "document_type": "blogpost", "type_of_material": "Blog", "multimedia": [{"url": "images/2012/02/05/arts/artsspecial/02-5BEST-slide-8K12/02-5BEST-slide-8K12-thumbWide.jpg", "height": 126, "type": "image", "legacy": {"wideheight": "126", "wide": "images/2012/02/05/arts/artsspecial/02-5BEST-slide-8K12/02-5BEST-slide-8K12-thumbWide.jpg", "widewidth": "190"}, "subtype": "wide", "width": 190}, {"url": "images/2012/02/05/arts/artsspecial/02-5BEST-slide-8K12/02-5BEST-slide-8K12-thumbStandard.jpg", "height": 75, "type": "image", "legacy": {"thumbnailheight": "75", "thumbnailwidth": "75", "thumbnail": "images/2012/02/05/arts/artsspecial/02-5BEST-slide-8K12/02-5BEST-slide-8K12-thumbStandard.jpg"}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75}], "blog": [], "lead_paragraph": null, "print_page": null, "section_name": "Arts"}, {"headline": {"main": "The Week in Culture Pictures, Feb. 3", "kicker": "ArtsBeat"}, "snippet": "A slide show of photographs of cultural events from this week....", "pub_date": "2012-02-03T18:26:59Z", "slideshow_credits": null, "news_desk": null, "word_count": 12, "keywords": [{"value": "News", "name": "type_of_material", "rank": "1"}], "abstract": "A slide show of photographs of cultural events from this week.", "_id": "4fd3a3338eb7c8105d8ec2d8", "source": "The New York Times", "byline": {"original": "By THE NEW YORK TIMES", "person": [], "organization": "THE NEW YORK TIMES"}, "web_url": "http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/03/the-week-in-culture-pictures-feb-3/", "subsection_name": null, "document_type": "blogpost", "type_of_material": "Blog", "multimedia": [], "blog": [], "lead_paragraph": "More Photographs", "print_page": null, "section_name": "Arts"}, {"headline": {"main": "App Smart Extra: Super Bowl Apps", "kicker": "Gadgetwise Blog"}, "snippet": "Most football fans will be forced to spend at least part of the weekend away from televised Super Bowl coverage.
