# Final Project 

# Analysis - 1
 - In analysis-1 I have tried to display the criminal activities of the city of Boston on the basis of the day of the week.
 - By seeing the results of the analysis one can easily predict the day on which most of the criminal activities happen in the      city.
 - I used pandas package to extract the crime data content of the city from the CSV file Crime_Report_Boston.csv using the          pd.read_csv() function.
 - I first extracted the unique values on the basis of crime scenes yearly.
 - I also aggregated the data according to the day of the week by Incident Type Description
 - Bar graph was plotted for the analysis to visualize which is the most active day of the week for criminal activities.
 - The plots shows us that the most active day for the criminal activity in the city of Boston is Friday. 
 - The graph shows the Criminal activities occurring according to days of the week.
 

# Analysis - 2
 - In the second analysis I have tried to display the criminal happenings and their numbers.
 - To extract the data in DataFrame format I have used the  pd.read_csv function from the pandas package.
 - The graph shows the number of occurrences of particular crime in the city of Boston of all the years.

# Analysis - 3
 - In Analysis 3, by using the same dataset I have tried to display the number of occurrences of all the different type of          crimes in the city.
 - I have extracted the count of the same type of crime by using the function value_counts().
 - Finally plotted the graph for the frequency of all the crime scenes

# Analysis - 4
 - In the fourth analysis, I have tried to analyze the crime data of Chicago Metropolitan area.
 - Here, the analysis of 4 different types of crimes namely 'BURGLARY', 'BATTERY', 'WEAPONS VIOLATION','PUBLIC PEACE VIOLATION'    is done to see the numbers and graph of these particular crimes.
 - The graph for all the types of crime activities is also plotted to get an idea about the happenings of these particular          crimes in comparison to all the crimes.
 - The analysis is done for all the years of the crime data in the Chicago Metropolitan area.

# Analysis - 5
 - Now that we have analyzed a lot of Boston crime data, in this anlysis I have tried to display the insights of the city of        Boston's crime activity pattern
 - I have tried to display the activity pattern of Boston's crime trends by the most frequent day of the month
 - The dates are parsed from the 'FROMDATE' column to extract the dates from the dataset.
 - The crime activity pattern is plotted with the Year, Month and DayofMonth data.
