Even through her long battle with cancer, Pat insisted on working. She truly loved what she did. Pat had a wonderful network of friends and family that meant the world to her. She was dedicated to her parents and extremely proud of both her Irish and Greek heritages. Pat also was involved with community affairs in her Queens, NY neighborhood.
